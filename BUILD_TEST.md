# Build Test Guide

## Issue Fixed
The build was failing due to a FileModal import issue. I've temporarily commented out the FileModal usage to get the build working.

## Changes Made
1. Commented out FileModal import in HomeLoggedUser.jsx
2. Commented out FileModal usage and related state
3. Created minimal netlify.toml

## Test the Build

### Option 1: Test Locally
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Commit and push changes
2. Trigger new deployment
3. Check if build succeeds

## Next Steps After Successful Build

### If Build Succeeds:
1. The issue was with FileModal component
2. We can then fix the FileModal component properly
3. Re-enable FileModal functionality

### If Build Still Fails:
1. Check for other import issues
2. Look at build logs for specific errors
3. Fix remaining issues one by one

## FileModal Fix Plan
Once build works, we'll:
1. Check FileModal component for syntax errors
2. Verify all dependencies are correct
3. Test FileModal in isolation
4. Re-enable FileModal functionality

## Current Status
- FileModal temporarily disabled
- Build should now work
- Ready for testing
