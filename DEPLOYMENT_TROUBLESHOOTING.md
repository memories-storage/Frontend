# Netlify Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
Multiple Netlify sites failing with header and redirect rule errors.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Minimal netlify.toml (Recommended)
Use the simplified `netlify.toml` with minimal configuration:

```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  publish = "build"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
```

### Option 2: Use Public Folder Files (Alternative)
If netlify.toml still fails, try using the public folder files:

**public/_redirects:**
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**public/_headers:**
```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

### Option 3: No Configuration Files (Last Resort)
If both options fail, try deploying without any configuration files:

1. Delete `netlify.toml`
2. Delete `public/_redirects`
3. Delete `public/_headers`
4. Configure everything in Netlify dashboard

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Test Locally
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Check Build Output
Ensure the `build` folder contains:
- `index.html`
- `static/` folder
- All your assets

### Step 3: Try Each Option
1. **Start with Option 1** (minimal netlify.toml)
2. **If it fails**, try Option 2 (public folder files)
3. **If both fail**, use Option 3 (no config files)

### Step 4: Netlify Dashboard Configuration
If using Option 3, configure in Netlify dashboard:

1. **Build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Node version: 18

2. **Redirects:**
   - From: `/*`
   - To: `/index.html`
   - Status: 200

3. **Headers:**
   - Path: `/*`
   - Headers: Add security headers manually

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Header rules failing"
**Solution:** Use minimal headers or no headers at all

### Issue: "Redirect rules failing"
**Solution:** Use simple redirect or configure in dashboard

### Issue: "Build timeout"
**Solution:** 
- Check for large dependencies
- Optimize build process
- Increase build timeout in dashboard

### Issue: "Node version mismatch"
**Solution:**
- Set NODE_VERSION = "18" in netlify.toml
- Or set in Netlify dashboard environment variables

## Environment Variables
If your app needs environment variables:

1. **Local testing:** Create `.env` file
2. **Netlify:** Add in Site settings > Environment variables

Common variables:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT`

## Success Checklist
- [ ] Local build works (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Build folder contains all files
- [ ] Netlify build completes
- [ ] Site deploys successfully
- [ ] React Router works (no 404s)
- [ ] All features work as expected

## If All Options Fail

1. **Check Netlify status:** https://status.netlify.com/
2. **Contact Netlify support** with build logs
3. **Try deploying to a different platform** (Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## Quick Fix Commands
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build

# Test build locally
npx serve -s build
```
