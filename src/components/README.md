# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable React components organized by functionality and scope.

## Structure:
- `common/` - Shared components used across multiple features
- `layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar, etc.)
- `ui/` - Basic UI components (Button, Input, Modal, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form-related components
- `features/` - Feature-specific components organized by domain

## Naming Convention:
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose
- Include index.js files for clean imports

## Best Practices:
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Include PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces
- Write unit tests for components
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
